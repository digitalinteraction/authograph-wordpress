**Authograph** is a way for photo-journalists and content creators to display a rich visual overlay of metadata onto their web-based images. Announced at World Press Photo Foundation awards ceremony 2016, this simple drop-in javascript library automatically augments seleted photos with additional content, curated by the content owner.

See the [Project Site](https://fourcorners.io) for more background on the project and future directions.
